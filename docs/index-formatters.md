# Formatters

In order to catch up with all the formatters available for different programming languages, we created two files as our guideline:

1. [Formatter Specifications](./formatters-spec.md) — Guidelines for formatter creators to have a smooth integration with `treefmt`
1. [Formatter Example](./formatters.md) — List of the available formatters with the corresponding configs that can be inserted into `treefmt.toml`
